Forensic Lab Report – BTLO Challenge: Shiba Insider

Date: August 30, 2025
Analyst: Patricio
Tools Utilized: Wireshark, CyberChef, Steghide, Exiftool, Command Line

1. Objective

The goal of this forensic challenge was to identify a potential insider within a simulated environment.
The task required analyzing network traffic, files, and image metadata to extract hidden information and determine the attacker’s profile.

2. Methodology and Findings
2.1 Network Traffic Analysis

Tool: Wireshark

The provided PCAP file was examined, revealing two HTTP transactions: a request (HTTP Request) and a response (HTTP Response).

The HTTP response contained the following message:
> use your own password
This served as a hint for subsequent authentication procedures.

2.2 ZIP File Access

Tool: CyberChef (Base64 decoding)

Credentials encoded in Base64 were identified in the HTTP response.

Decoding yielded:

Username: fakeblue

Password: redforever

These credentials successfully unlocked file.zip.

The README.txt confirmed that no additional passwords were required.

2.3 Image Metadata Examination

Tool: Exiftool

Metadata analysis revealed an unusual entry:

Field: Technique

Value: Steganography

This indicated the presence of hidden data within the image file.

2.4 Hidden Data Extraction

Tool: Steghide

Steghide was used to extract the hidden content from the image.

The extracted text file contained a unique ID:
> 0726ba878ea47de571777a

2.5 Insider Identification

The extracted ID was consistent with user ID lengths in the BTLO platform.

Using the ID to search within BTLO revealed the insider’s profile:
> bluetiger

3. Conclusions


The HTTP response message provided guidance for password retrieval.

Credentials decoded from Base64 enabled access to the ZIP file.

Hidden information in the image was successfully discovered and extracted using metadata analysis and steganography tools.

The extracted ID led directly to the identification of the insider as bluetiger.
